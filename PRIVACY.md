# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-11

## Overview

Lingko is designed with privacy at its core. We don't collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data.

## Data Collection

We don't collect any personal data. No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry.

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device using:

- **iOS**: Apple's on-device storage (SwiftData)
- **Android**: Local SQLite database (Room)

This data never leaves your device and can be deleted by removing the app or clearing app data.

## Third-Party Services

### iOS

The app uses Apple's on-device Translation framework. Translation happens entirely on your device. Language packs are downloaded from Apple when needed.

### Android

The app uses Google ML Kit for on-device translation and text recognition. These services run entirely on your device. Language models are downloaded from Google when needed for offline use.

**Important**: No text you translate is sent to any server. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Permissions

- **Photos** (via Photo Picker): Only used when you choose to translate text from images. Images are processed locally and never uploaded.

## Changes to This Policy

We'll update this policy if our practices change. Continued use means acceptance of updates.
